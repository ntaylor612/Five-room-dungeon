            Grippli - Gripplis are shy and cautious people who generally seek to avoid being drawn into the 
            complicated and dangerous affairs of others. Despite their outlook and small stature, gripplis 
            often take bold and noble action when the situation demands it. Reclusive and canny, gripplis are
            treetop survivalists who harvest their homes' bounty and defend themselves against terrible 
            threats. Their reliance on cunning and simple tools has led to gripplis being mischaracterized
            as primitive, yet this overlooks their shaping of the land with hidden orchards and camouflaged 
            causeways that allow gripplis to live in prosperous peace. Gripplis are most likely to emerge 
            from their forest homes to trade, explore, and combat threats that would despoil the world.

            vishkanyas are survivors. Throughout history, fear of their deadly abilities forced vishkanyas
            to experience subjugation, exploitation, and ostracizing. 
            Yet through it all, they endured. Now free of chains to bind them, vishkanyas live in
