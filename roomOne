walk, but then he calls out, "Do you know the Wayne Manor Secret?" stopping you in your tracks. Your curiosity gets the 
better of you and you walk back towards the man. Asking what he means, he regales the tale about the Wayne Manor Casino.
Hes not very trustworthy and you don't really believe him but you cant shake this feeling you need to check the Wayne 
Manor yourself to see if what he said was true.
