#room 3

print("""You walk into the next room carefully, looking out for any traps there may be. Despite everything, you find 
yourself intrigued about what awaits for you in the new room.

You enter the room fully and the door slams shut behind you. You've got nothing to do but look around. It seems to be a
very normal room full of nothing but abandoned stuff and machines. This honestly surprised you because after the last
room you were expecting something to come out of nowhere and attack you. This is oddly peaceful.. surely something will 
attack me right...?

At this point you don't know if you were just being paranoid. But even so you weren't about to take the risk by just 
standing here. As you continue walking through the room you see something out of the corner of your eye. It was a pile
of treasure! A shiny stack of diamonds, sapphires, and rubies!
